        <h3>Are you really in all countries?</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, not yet, but our offices are in quite a large number of countries and we continue to grow
          every year! You can find a list of all the countries in which we are currently located in the Contacts
          section</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I buy a house if I am in another country?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you have the right to buy a home after you sign all the documents and give your consent to buy without a
          personal inspection. In this case, we will provide you with all the information about the building you are
          interested in (text, photo, video), and after discussing all the details, we will send you the contract for
          signing.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How can I sign the contract?</h3>
        <p>You actually have several options. The first of them is the signing of the contract immediately after the
          inspection of the house. To do this, you should inform us a little in advance, then our broker will take all
          the necessary documents with him. The second - if you are not sure and want to think again, you just tell the
          realtor, and when you decide, you can call us and we will either come to you, or you will come to our office
          (other options are possible depending on personal needs). And the third option is to sign the contract online
          thanks to the electronic signature, or physical documents that we will send to you by mail.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>If I don't have the full amount now?</h3>
        <p>It's OK! Buying your own home is a lot of money and we understand that well, that's why we offer you
          interest-free installments up from 1 to 60 years! The main thing is not to worry, we will be able to agree on
          a convenient option for you and you will have the house of your dreams in your beloved country.</p>
